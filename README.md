Shuffle
=======

An application that produces a randomly ordered list of values.

Introduction
------------

Shuffle takes a single positive integer as input (N) and produces a list of integers in the range 1..N shuffled in a random order.

It uses the [Fisher-Yates Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher-Yates_shuffle) to produce the list as fast a reasonably possible regardless of size.

It has the capability of taking any 32-bit integer input.
